LibVLC on Android demo with multiple instances
This is a sample application demonstrating the use of libVLC on Android.

This repository contains only sample code, and the libVLC on Android sdk (vlc-sdk.7z) must be built and placed into the target application's source code directory.

Getting started
Requirements:

Generate sdk files of patched VLC You can find the repo here: https://github.com/coderReview/Android-VLC-Patches

Now, just copy them into the app and run it

Debugging
Having problems making some media play?

Use adb logcat to read the debug logs. This is analogous to Tools â†’ Messages (verbosity 2) in desktop VLC.

In addition, try different configurations of hardware acceleration, chroma, and deblocking. Android devices vary greatly in their capabilities.
